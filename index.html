  <h2> Fritz's Origin </h2>
    <p>We unfortunately do not know much about Fritz's origin, other than he came from a shelter located in Florida. 
      We can make all the assumptions in the world about whether or not his previous owners did this or that, but the truth is:
      it really doesn't matter. That little guy is where he needs to be and is getting all the love in the world he can possibly get.
      We told ourselves at first that he was the lucky one, but now we know who the lucky ones really are.</p>
  <h2> Fritz's Journey </h2>
    <p>Our little min-pin made his journey from Florida shelter to PAWS in Chicago (Bucktown) in Spring of 2019. We had been talking about getting
      a pooch for what seemed like forever and after some deliberate searching for the 'pup' we wanted, we decided to just go there and see 
      for ourselves. It was a somewhat discouraging and heartfelt visit, most certainly because of Fritz, but mainly because we realized there
      are so many pets in need. Many we looked at needed the care and attention we could not possibly give them, and that was heartbreaking.
      We were almost ready to leave and come back another day when the volunteers at the main desk asked us if we had visited this little guy
      that had just arrived only a couple days ago. He was being held in a small cage in a room with a couple other pooches.  I'll never forget
      walking past and peering into that room to see him in a ball, looking out with concern for this new place and all the new people. We asked 
      to see him and they put us in a visiting room while they got him out of his cage.  The volunteers at PAWS opened the door to let him in and 
      he came running towards us with a wagged tail and ears back because he still wasn't sure about us but could not help his excitement at being
      'out in the world.' This was all we needed to see to know he would have a happy forever home with us. We did not even hesitate.</p>
  <h2> Fritz's Forever Home: Urbs in Horto </h2>
    <p>When we brought him home, we knew it would take time for him to feel at peace and find happiness in his forever home. Fritz loves his squeeky
    toys (of which he has many), playing fetch and loves running around the house. His favorite place to go is the dog park/beach at Montrose Harbor. 
    The first time we took him there he was so excited at the abundance of free space that he temporarily forgot we were there with him. When he remembered
    who had brought him there, we saw him run to the entrance of the park and start barking. It was easily the cutest thing he had done since we rescued him.
    He has definitely done equally and greater cute things since. When we're looking for a quick fix to playtime, we take him to Holstein Park near home 
    in Bucktown or the two nearest dog parks: Logan Square(pictured above) or Wicker Park(near the 606 trail). We are nearing his first Gotcha Day in May.
    We will probably get him another peanut butter cake like we did for his birthday in November (<i>if</i> we spoil him!).</p>
